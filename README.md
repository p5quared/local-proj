#Blue Moon Cafe, Saranac Lake

Hey there, this is a project that I made for "Blue Moon Cafe", a small, local business in Saranac Lake, NY. 
Some of the problems I've found on the original site include slow load times, unnecessary images, and also a poor navigation strategy.
My main goals are to simplify navigation and make it more intuitive, and also to minimize distractions from important information.

I've opted for a minimal design, loosely based off of some other modern restaurant's sites I have seen.
I've taken some of the resources like colors and images from the original Blue Moon Cafe website.


The project was created using React, a javacript library for building interfaces.
